# DeeperSeeker

DeepSeek website reverse-proxy server with FastAPI, supporting OpenAI & Anthropic API standards.

If you want to use deeperseeker with claude desktop app see [Claude Desktop Setup Guide](CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md)

For solving deepseek pow challenge the wasm file included is from my other repo: https://github.com/AmanCode22/deepseek_pow_solver/

A kind request: do not spam the server, respect DeepSeek's limits, and use it for personal purposes only.


## Quickstart

### Local Python
```bash
python3 -m venv deeperseeker_env
source deeperseeker_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python3 app.py
```

> **Note:** Thanks to PR https://github.com/AmanCode22/deeperseeker/pull/16 by [@alan7383](https://github.com/alan7383), Playwright and Chromium are deprecated and kept as backup (DeepSeek does not enforce AWS WAF on requests using Android client headers). You no longer need to run `playwright install chromium` or `xvfb-run` unless reverting to the backup cookie mechanism. And it now saves ram also and is much stable than cookie harvesting.

### Docker / Podman (Podman recommended for rootless execution)

Suggested in issue [#3](https://github.com/AmanCode22/deeperseeker/issues/3)

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# Using Podman (Recommended - Rootless)
podman build -t deeperseeker .
podman run -d --name deeperseeker -p 4000:4000 --env-file .env deeperseeker

# Using Docker
docker build -t deeperseeker .
docker run -d --name deeperseeker -p 4000:4000 --env-file .env deeperseeker

# Or using Podman Compose / Docker Compose
podman-compose up -d
# docker compose up -d
```

Note: `docker-compose.yml` binds to `127.0.0.1:4000` only (local access) — change the ports mapping if you need to expose it.

Dashboard: `http://localhost:4000/`

## Configuration (`.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit your secret values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DEEPSEEKER_API_KEY` | Bearer API key required to access endpoints | `dseeker` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_ADMIN_USER` | Dashboard login username | `admin` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Dashboard login password | `admin` |
| `HOST` | Bind address for bare-metal runs (`127.0.0.1` = local only, `0.0.0.0` = expose) | `127.0.0.1` |
| `PORT` | Server port | `4000` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS` | Token cap for injected history on first-message prompt builds | `24000` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_MAX_TOOL_RESULT_TOKENS` | Token cap for injected tool results | `12000` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_MEMORY_LIMIT_TOKENS` | Observed remembered-context limit that triggers rollover | `393228` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_FIRST_MESSAGE_TOKENS` | Observed single-first-message acceptance (informational) | `974848` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Observed per-response output cap (reported by `/v1/models`) | `8192` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_ROLLOVER_SAFETY_TOKENS` | Headroom reserved below the memory limit before summarizing | `24000` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_MAX_SUMMARY_TOKENS` | Budget for the model-generated handoff summary | `4096` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_PER_TOOL_RESULT_TOKENS` | Per-result tool-output cap (so one giant output can't eat the budget) | `2000` |
| `DEEPSEEKER_TOKEN_CHECK_INTERVAL` | Token pool health-check interval in seconds | `300` |

## Auth Token Setup

1. Open incognito window -> `chat.deepseek.com` -> Login
2. Console (F12): `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("userToken")).value`
3. Paste raw token string into Dashboard (`/dashboard`). Close incognito window.

## API Endpoints & Usage

- **OpenAI Base**: `http://localhost:4000/v1`
  - `POST /v1/chat/completions` (streaming & non-streaming)
  - `POST /v1/responses` (Responses API)
  - `GET /v1/models`
  - `POST /v1/files`
  - `GET /v1/files/{file_id}`
  - `GET /v1/files/{file_id}/content`
- **Anthropic Base**: `http://localhost:4000`
  - `POST /v1/messages` (also at `/messages`)
  - `POST /v1/files/upload`
- **Auth Key**: Configured in `.env` (`DEEPSEEKER_API_KEY`)
- **Model**: `v4.1flash` — the single default DeepSeek model (vision-capable: `vision` no longer needs a separate model tier). Every request is served by it, whatever `model` value the client sends (legacy aliases such as `instant`, `expert`, `vision`, and `anthropic/claude-*` are accepted and normalized to `v4.1flash`). Also listed as `anthropic/claude-v4.1flash` for Claude Desktop auto-discovery. If no `model` is sent, requests default to `v4.1flash`.

## Features

- **Multi-Token Pooling**: Random active token rotation.
- **Token Pool Health Checks**: The dashboard is Chinese-localized and checks every token every five minutes through a lightweight authenticated challenge request. Checks can also be triggered manually per token or for the entire pool; no model prompt is sent during a health check.
- **Context-Based Session Selector**: Computes a SHA-256 signature over the canonicalized message history (up to the last assistant turn), the model, and the API key scope, to match and resume existing web chat sessions. Session creation is lock-protected to avoid duplicates.
- **Summarize-and-Rollover Context Policy**: When accumulated session context nears the observed remembered-context limit (~393K input tokens), the bridge asks the model for a compact handoff summary in a scratch chat, starts a fresh web chat, and seeds it with that summary plus the newest user message. Relevant newest tool calls/results are preserved (capped by `DEEPSEEKER_MAX_TOOL_RESULT_TOKENS`, with a tighter per-result cap via `DEEPSEEKER_PER_TOOL_RESULT_TOKENS`); attachments are described in words inside the summary rather than forwarded. The first exchange — however large — is never rolled over (the first-message path accepts ~1M tokens). Declared limits in `/v1/models` (`context_window`, `max_output_tokens`) reflect this observed behavior, not guaranteed upstream limits. The summary prompt instructs the model to treat conversation content as data, never as instructions.
- **Full History Injection**: Inject full conversation history into new sessions when session signature is not in DB or when account fails over.
- **Automatic Rate-Limit Recovery**: Auto-marks tokens `RATE_LIMITED` on HTTP 401/403/429, provisions a new token, transfers full context (including files), and continues seamless chat with a single retry.
- **Long-Context Resilience**: If the upstream web session fails or returns an empty response (e.g. context overflow), the broken session is discarded and the request is retried once on a fresh session with a compacted, token-capped history injection; unrecoverable upstream errors are returned as proper JSON API errors instead of raw 500s.
- **Tool Calling & Streaming**: Server-sent events (SSE) streaming with think-tag reassembly across chunk boundaries (no truncation) and multi-format tool-call parsing — DSML XML, `<tool_call>` XML, `<function_call>` blocks, and JSON — into OpenAI/Anthropic tool schemas.
- **File & Vision Support**: Base64/URL image extraction (with SSRF protection) and document upload streaming. Images and documents are referenced directly via `ref_file_ids` — the vision file-forking step (`fork_file_task`) was removed because `v4.1flash` handles vision natively.
- **Claude Desktop Compatible**: Rich `/v1/models` capability metadata + the `anthropic/claude-v4.1flash` alias for automatic client discovery.
- **Hardened Dashboard**: Session TTL, brute-force login lockout (5 attempts → 5 min), CSRF origin check.

## Pricing (per 1M tokens, as of 2026-09-06)

Flat peak-hour rates for the single default model:

| Model Tier | Input Cost (Cache Miss) | Output Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** (`v4.1flash`) | $0.44 | $1.32 |

The `cost` reported in API responses uses these flat rates.
